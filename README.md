## Welcome to Link-Up Manoa!

Link-Up Manoa is a new way for students to connect and study with each other in the digital era. By organizing face to face study sessions using an online platform, this allows an efficient and effective way for students to cross the barrier of asking for help, and leverages the pros of study groups and peer mentorship.
